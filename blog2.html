<h2>tough parts of the assignment</h2>
<p>I found ount that I am pretty rusty at css styling as I want throught the assignment. Althought I was somewhat familiar with flexbox, I was not really prepared for creating a flexbox component with a navbar type input portion next to it. The part that I found the most difficult was the button animations and the hyperlink animations. It did take me a little bit to acually make the different animations trigger when the cursor hovered over them. Luicly I was able to google search my way to the right answers.</p>

<h2>rescouces that were used</h2>
<p> Whereas I found them very helpful for last assignment I found stack overflow and the rescources provided from the clas website not super helpful for this assignment. I used a lot of articles from w3schools in order to find the different tags and options of styling that I needed.</p>
