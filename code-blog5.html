<h1>Code Blog .5 *10</h1>
<h2>problems found</h2>
<p1> WELL I found a lot of problems this round around. Handlebars was a mess to get going. the engineering servers were kind of messed up when it came to getting it working. similarly when it came to getting my local macine to actually work with the handlebars script, the windows termanal ( power shell included) did not allow it at all. After a bit of diging I found out that windows as an operating system does not allow scripts from "unknown manufacturers" by default. so I had to add to dig into a dozen system files and turn a single near impossible to find sys variable to false. Additionlly my github descided not to work. I committed a dozen different times, and literal hours after I've finished the assignment I still cannot actually get it on my repo. The same thing happened in my last assignemnt according to my ta. Additionally I cannot host these code blogs because the OSU servers apperently don't have the ability to host anymore. I am not an engineering student, and the engineering servers didn't let me in dispite the post that Hess sent in the zoom chat. Additionally now that the non-engineering sites are all shut down my previous code blogs aren't up anymore. The assignment itself wasn't too bad. Getting to the assignemnt, however was hellish. </p1>

<h2>What did I learn from the assignemnt</h2>
<p1> using third person libraries are guarenteed to have complitations. using Handlebars with windows took soooooo much extra pain and garbage to get through that it wasn't worth it in the end. Also OSU infrastructure apparently can't handle uploading code blogs.</p1>

<h2>suggestions for next time around</h2>
<p>making sure that all students are able to get a code blog up and running on the school servers would be nice. </p>
