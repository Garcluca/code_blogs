<h2> Assignment 1</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The biggest challange for me when completing this assigment was the use of git and github. Up until this point I was mostly able to get by just using my own directories and sharing code for collaborative work using a platform using codeanywhere. I was able to ameleorate this setback by going through the Git-It tutorial that was suggested as a part of the assignment's readme. As a result I feel I now have a good grasp of the fundimentals of using git. </li><br>
    <li>I already knew most of the basics of HTML. However I was a little unfamiliar with the more neuanced elements that were avalible to use such as code and address tags. </li><br>
    <li>git-it and the 'introduction to HTML" article in included in the html Readings section were both very good recources for this assignment. I used the HTML tutorial to brush up on the basics, and used git-it to get some hands on expirence using git and github.</li>
