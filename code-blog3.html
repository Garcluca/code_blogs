<h1>* What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems? </h1>
<p> the most challenging part of the assignment for me was probaly adding different html on the page using javascript. That aspect of the project produced the most bugs by far. I solved it by writhing a function that generally handled creating a post which made an easy module that I used to plug in to the verious parts of the assignemnt that required th creation of html elements.</p>
<h1>* What did you learn from the assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h1>
<p>I learned how to use vanilla javascript to dynamically alter the page as well as store values and posts. creating a class to manage the posts was far easier than keeping then applying a hidden class th the existing posts.</p>
<h1> * What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment?  Specific websites?  Lectures?  The class Piazza forum?  The TAs?  How did you use each of these resources?</h1>
<p> I found that stackoverflow was somewhat helpful for very specific questions. for a more gneralized information center I used w3schools and the msn docs to get a deeper understanding of the content that I needed to produce as well as how to manage the DOM</p>
<h1>* What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h1>
<p>I had to do quite a bit of google searching in order to find out how iterate through the various selected options of the conditions tab. Additionally I spent a good while on reading up on the different ways to add html to the DOM without using inner html like I usually would have done.</p>
